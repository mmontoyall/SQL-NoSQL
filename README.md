# SQL-NoSQL
Project contains both examples of previous SQL query projects as well as NOSQL using MongoDB


SQL:
In this project we will be working with the commonly-used Lahman baseball statistics database (our friends at the San Francisco Giants tell us they use it!) The database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2019. It includes data from the two current leagues (American and National), four other "major" leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875.

NOSQ (MONGODB):
Worked with a subset of the MovieLens Dataset. Unlike the data set used in SQL, the table here won't be organized in tables of records but rather as collections of documents! Documents are similar to records in the sense that they are used to group together pieces of data, but unlike the records we covered for SQL databases, documents can have fields that are not primitive data types.
